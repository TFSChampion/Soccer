This project is a solution for the Robocup Junior Soccer competition. The goal of the competition is to build two autonomous robots that can play soccer against each other.

## Hardware

The robots are built using an EV3 LEGO Mindstorms kit. Each robot has two large motors for driving and one medium motor for kicking the ball. It also has a color sensor to detect the ball and a gyro sensor for orientation.

## Software

The software for the robots is written in Python using the Pybricks library. Each robot uses a combination of state machines and PID control to move around the field, dribble the ball, and score goals.

The robots communicate with each other using infrared communication. This allows them to coordinate their movements and avoid collisions.

## Installation

To run the software on the robots, you will need to install the Pybricks library on the EV3 brick. This can be done using the Pybricks MicroPython firmware and the Pybricks IDE. Once the firmware is installed, you can connect the EV3 bricks to your computer using USB and upload the Python code to the bricks.

## Usage

To start the game, turn on both robots and place them on opposite sides of the field. The robots will then start playing soccer against each other. You can monitor the game using the EV3 brick's LCD screens.
